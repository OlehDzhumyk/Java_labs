Good morning, Doctor Rudra, how are you doing?
Good morning, Jane. I am doing well. And you?
I'm great, thank you. This is my friend Leila. She is thinking about
joining the hospital, but she has a few questions about the administration there. Would you mind telling
her about the administration, please?
Hello, Leila! It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm more than happy to speak with you.
Please stop by my chamber tomorrow. It's a pleasure to meet you, Doctor. Thank you so much for helping us.
Don't mention it. Hopefully, I will be able to help you out in this matter.
